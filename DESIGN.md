# Koda Design Decisions

This document captures architectural decisions and their rationale.
For the TUI architecture (v0.1.2), see [#70](https://github.com/lijunzh/koda/issues/70).
For workspace structure and developer docs, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Vision

Koda is a personal AI assistant. Coding is the starting point, but the platform
will expand to support email, messaging, calendar, reminders, documentation,
and knowledge management — all powered by the same engine.

## Execution Modes

```bash
koda                      # Auto-starts embedded engine + CLI client (default)
koda -p "fix the bug"     # Headless mode (direct engine, no server)
koda server --stdio       # ACP server over stdio (for editor integration)
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Engine as a Library, Not a Process

**Decision**: The engine is a Rust library crate (`koda-core`) with zero IO.
It communicates exclusively through `EngineEvent` (output) and `EngineCommand`
(input) enums. See `koda-core/src/engine/event.rs` for the protocol definition.

**Rationale**: Studied four projects:
- **xi-editor**: Used stdio JSON-RPC. Discontinued. Lesson: protocol becomes
  bottleneck when core and frontend are separate processes.
- **Zed**: Keeps `agent` (engine) and `agent_ui` (rendering) as separate crates
  in the same binary. Engine has zero UI imports.
- **Goose**: Rust engine + ACP server + multiple frontends (Electron, Ink TUI, CLI).
- **Neovim**: C core + msgpack-RPC. Terminal TUI is just one client.

**Zed's approach wins**: engine and primary client in the same binary. Server
mode is optional for external clients.

### 2. ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

**Decision**: Koda's server mode will speak ACP.

**Rationale**: Both Zed and Goose independently converged on ACP
(`@agentclientprotocol/sdk`). ACP defines session management, streaming
messages, tool calls with permissions, and status updates — exactly what
Koda needs. Adopting ACP gives us Zed integration for free.

### 3. Single Binary Philosophy

**Decision**: `cargo install koda-cli` gives you everything. No separate
server process required for normal usage.

**Rationale**: Koda's core value is zero-config simplicity. The CLI client
talks to the engine via in-process `tokio::mpsc` channels. Server mode is
opt-in (`koda server`) for external clients.

### 4. Async Approval Flow

**Decision**: Tool approval is an async request/response, not a blocking
function call.

**Rationale**: In server mode, the approval decision comes from a remote
client. The engine emits `EngineEvent::ApprovalRequest` and awaits
`EngineCommand::ApprovalResponse` — works identically over in-process
channels or network transport.

### 5. Database Evolution

**Decision**: Keep SQLite for now. Introduce a `Persistence` trait so the
backend can be swapped later.

**Rationale**: SQLite is excellent for conversations, sessions, and AST cache.
But email, calendar, documents, and knowledge graphs may require full-text
search (FTS5), vector embeddings, graph relationships, or multi-device sync.
The trait boundary lets us evolve without rewriting.
